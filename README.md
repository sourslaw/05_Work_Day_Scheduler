- WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
